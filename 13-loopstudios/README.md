[Loopstudios Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw)

[Finished Project](https://janegca.github.io/fem-challenges/13-loopstudios/index.html)

## Criteria

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included
for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without
JS!

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Presentation and Visual Components

There are four basic visual components (no shadows or rounded corners):

- hero/header
- intro
- creations
- foot

### Spacing

The components are spaced 96px apart in mobile design The hero and intro are
160px apart, remaining are 184px apart (make proportionate to viewport width?)

### Effects

Links (menu and social icons)

- 3ch centered underline on hover/focus
- cursor pointer

Button

- text and background colours flip on hover/focus
- cursor pointer

Grid Image

- overlay on hover, text set to black

- 3 elements:

## Issues

1. The logo needs to be retained at the top of the screen (so the whole navbar
   needs to appear and be fixed, just as on the desktop)
   - ‚úîÔ∏è FIXED: set `z-index: 10` on `.ls-Hero_navbar` to keep it on top, lifts
     the logo with it
1. üî¥ Close 'x' on open hamburger menu can be scrolled off the top of the page
   - no luck disabling the scroll, couldn't get `sticky` to work either üòí
1. Need a rethink on spacing, padding for sections!!!
   - ‚úîÔ∏è FIXED this by adding Andy Bell's `full-bleed` utility class to
     `ls-Header` and `ls-Footer`, allowed the `ls` class to be used as the
     sizing wrapper for the page which meant I could remove max-width and
     padding from a number of the other classes
1. Look at 700-800px screen sizes, may need to add media query for `ls-Hero`,
   menu not fully shown
   - ‚úîÔ∏è FIXED: changed `width` on @media query for .ls-Hero_navbar to
     `max-width`

## Notes

- decided to use SASS for modular capabilities, writing in pure CSS for the
  moment but storing in .scss files for modularity and minification
  - üî∏need to remember to reference images from the project directory and not
    the scss directory
- blah, wasted ages trying to position the `ls-Intro_details` first using
  `flex`, then using negative margins and padding, gave up on the padding and
  switched to using absolute position and a grid and voila!
- used a `figure picture img` pattern for the grid gallery as:
  - the images needed a linear gradient overlay which can not be styled directly
    on a replaced element
  - the images came in two flavours: desktop and mobile, the `picture` tag works
    well when loading images based on `media` queries
  - the images needed a text overlay, `figcaption` works great for this and
    `figure` provides access to pseudo-elements which can be used to create the
    image linear gradient overlays

This took me a lot longer than I'd anticipated, went down the rabbit hole on a
few things and got distracted by Keith Grant's _CSS in Depth_ and Andy Bell's
_CUBE_ methodology (time well spent in both cases). There is still a lot of room
for improvement but I think I will leave it for a refactor exercise.

Also, think I may forgo the single repo pattern for these challenges now that I
am using SASS for modularization as I can't figure out how to target sub-dirs
for _Live SASS Compiler_. Life might be simpler if I just create individual
repos using a naming structure like `fem-jr-proj_name`. Also need to rethink my
class name strategy; use `.sc-name` for _standard component_, `.sw-name` for
_standard wrapper_ and `.ns-name` for project namespace (ns) class names?? Have
to give it some thought as the names I used in this project are a mishmash of
different ideas.
