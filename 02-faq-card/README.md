# FAQ Accordian Card (Newbie)

## Criteria

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen
  size (Mobile: 375px, Desktop: 1440px)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## Design Decisions

- designed for mobile (375px) first, media query will handle large page sizes
- decided the graphic was not part of the FAQ itself but a presentation element,
  gave it its own section
- used a free online site (aconvert.com) to rotate the icon-arrow-down.svg
  figure and create an icon-arrow-up.svg file
