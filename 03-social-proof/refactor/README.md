## Presentation and Components

The design is described as a _section_ so assume the intent is to always present
the subcomponents together and that the section can appear anywhere on a page.

- there are 3 basic subcomponents: text intro, ratings, testimonies
- the Intro has two elements: heading, details
- Ratings consists of a number of rating elements
  - a Rating has two elements:
    - stars (graphics)
    - source (text)
- a Testimony has 2 visual subcomponents:
  - reviewer identity
    - a reviewer is identified by an:
      - avatar
      - name and descriptor (keep together)
  - text of the review
