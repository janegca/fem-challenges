## Basic Approach to the Challenges

1. Create a single git repo for all Frontend Mentor challenges and a separate
   folder and branch for each project (did not create a separate branch for the
   first project)
1. Create a README for each project folder to keep track of design decisions,
   references used, issues that you'd like to resolve down the road, insights,
   etc.
1. Download the challenge and read the directions and style-guide

   - Review the design with the above in mind, making note of general
     appearance, sections, components, similarities across sections/pages,
     graphics, etc.

1. HTML
   - Structure the content and layout using semantic HTML, keeping in mind the
     needs of the largest design layout. What needs to be grouped? What may need
     positioning? Where are wrappers and/or containers needed? Use
     understandable class names.
1. CSS
   - Design for mobile first
   - Define custom properties (adapt
     [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)'s naming style)
   - Focus on general styles first
   - Add enhancements one section at a time to keep commits as clean as possible
   - Refactor as necessary
1. Review code, cleanup where necessary
1. Run the HTML and CSS through the W3 Validators, make any necessary
   corrections
1. Test on mobile phone and desktop, and try live pages on the
   [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) cleanup
   where necessary
1. Submit solution on Frontend Mentor
1. Correct any Accessibility problems identified by Frontend Mentor
