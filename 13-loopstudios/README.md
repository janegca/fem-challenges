JS!

## Notes

- decided to use SASS for modular capabilities, writing in pure CSS for the
  moment but storing in .scss files for modularity and minification
  - ðŸ”¸need to remember to reference images from the project directory and not
    the scss directory
- blah, wasted ages trying to position the `ls-Intro_details` first using flex,
  then using negative margins and padding, gave up on the padding and switched
  to using absolute position and a grid and voila!

## Issues

Need to rethink/rewrite the hamburger menu:

1. the logo needs to be retained at the top of the screen (so the whole navbar
   needs to appear and be fixed, just as on the desktop)
1. when it opens, the 'x' can be scrolled off the top of the page
