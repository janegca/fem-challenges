## Criteria

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field
    Name] cannot be empty"_

    should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error
    should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
