Design and coding challenges from
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)

## Basic Approach to the Challenges

1. Create a single git repo for all Frontend Mentor challenges and a separate
   folder and branch for each project (did not create a separate branch for the
   first project)
1. Create a README for each project folder to keep track of design decisions,
   references used, issues that you'd like to resolve down the road, insights,
   etc.
1. Download the challenge and read the directions and style-guide

   - Review the design with the above in mind, making note of general
     appearance, sections, components, similarities across sections/pages,
     graphics, etc.

1. HTML - Structure the content using semantic HTML
1. CSS
   - Define custom properties (adapt
     [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)'s naming style)
   - Focus on general styles first
   - Add enhancements one section at a time to keep commits as clean as possible
   - Refactor as necessary
1. Review code, cleanup where necessary
1. Run the HTML and CSS through the W3 Validators, make any necessary
   corrections
1. Submit solution on Frontend Mentor
