# FAQ Accordian Card (Newbie)

## Criteria

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen
  size (Mobile: 375px, Desktop: 1440px)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## Design Decisions/Steps

- designed for mobile (375px) first, media query will handle large page sizes
- decided the graphic was not part of the FAQ itself but a presentation element,
  gave it its own section

- got the mobile design working reasonably well but then had to do a whole
  re-think for the larger design ðŸ™„

## Issues

- The graphics appear to scale correctly except for the box, why??
- Mobile graphic not being loaded, instead the desktop one shrinks

### Refactor

Modified the HTML to load the images using the `picture`tag. The mobile graphics
now loads correctly when the screen shrinks.

NOTE: the`id`for the woman and pattern are set on the default`img` tag BUT they
still apply when the desktop images are replaced by the mobile images, which is
very cool, thought I would need different id's for the different images.
