## Notes

- decided to use SASS for modular capabilities, writing in pure CSS for the
  moment but storing in .scss files for modularity and minification
  - üî∏need to remember to reference images from the project directory and not
    the scss directory
- blah, wasted ages trying to position the `ls-Intro_details` first using
  `flex`, then using negative margins and padding, gave up on the padding and
  switched to using absolute position and a grid and voila!

## Issues

1. The logo needs to be retained at the top of the screen (so the whole navbar
   needs to appear and be fixed, just as on the desktop)
   - ‚úîÔ∏è FIXED: set `z-index: 10` on `.ls-Hero_navbar` to keep it on top, lifts
     the logo with it
1. Close 'x' on open hamburger menu can be scrolled off the top of the page
1. Need a rethink on spacing, padding for sections!!!
   - ‚úîÔ∏è FIXED this by adding Andy Bell's `full-bleed` utility class to
     `ls-Header` and `ls-Footer`, allowed the `ls` class to be used as the
     sizing wrapper for the page which meant I could remove max-width and
     padding from a number of the other classes
