## Issue

The background graphics move around as the window is resized, would be nicer if
they scaled gracefully.

### Fix

[ApplePieGiraffe](https://github.com/ApplePieGiraffe/profile-card-component)
posted a solution that places and sizes the background images with respect to
the viewport, net result is that the background images appear relatively fixed
as the viewport changes size.
