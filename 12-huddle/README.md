Your challenge is to build out this landing page from the designs provided in
the starter code.

## Design Overview

  - background graphic: 2 sizes, mobile and desktop

## Icons

Free to choose which social icons are used, suggestions are:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/)

## Notes and Issues

### Graphic and Intro

Had some problems with these two for the desktop layout until I came across
Stephanie Eckles
[Modern CSS Solutions #16](https://moderncss.dev/3-popular-website-heroes-created-with-css-grid-layout/)
on styling hero sections using a one cell grid.

### Social Icons

Used Ionicons. The design widths are 27.5px for mobile, 40px for desktop;
however, I've opted to use 48px for both as that is the recommended size for
accessible 'hit' targets on touch screens.

ðŸŒž Woot! Figured out a very easy way to colour the icons using a mask and the
`aria-label` attribute based on reading
[CSS-Tricks: Change Color of SVG on Hover](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/)
by Chris Coyier and a concept from Ben Frain's
[Enduring CSS](https://ecss.benfrain.com/) methodology, about using WIA-Aria
attributes for progressive enhancements.

However, Chrome requires a polyfill `-webkit-mask-image: url(...)`
